Hello, thats my educational JavaScript pet project.

Game idea based on google chrome dino game.

Whats new?

-TexturePacks shop. Already added 2 packs.

-Second stage. First stage is a default dino game. When player reach N qty of points, game will start the second stage.
		
	*Now dino runs in spaceship
	*Player task - fly away and survive the ufo attack.
	*Added new feature - shoot.
	*Added cheat code.

KeyBinds:
	W/S - Up & Jump/Down & Bend down.
	F - Shoot.

Minuses:
	Weak hud system - Created without a class.
	Confusing coordinate system - Developed for positioning repair, but doesn't help. All thats system can be replaced with Element.getBoundingClientRect().
	confusion with myObject and Enemies classes - Enemy class replaced by myObject, and that makes it unnecessary.
I described main problems of this project. 
Thanks for attention.
